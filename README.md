# Observability:
Observability is project focused on bringing monitoring to scientific applications.
It is designed to work with supercomputer from Cyfronet AGH (Ares) 

# System:
System for collecting, storing and providing access to monitoring data is build from several components. Below diagram ilustrates connections between them:

# Deployment:


All the necessary files for deploying the monitoring system are included in this repository. The system is designed to run as multiple Docker containers.
To enable telemetry data collection, you must specify the HTTP endpoint for the collector.

## Launching Steps:
- Clone this repository into the directory where you want to run the Docker containers.
- Review the `docker-compose.yaml` file to ensure that the selected ports are available and configure the HTTP endpoint for the collector.
- Update the `COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT` in the `monitoring.sh` script to match the new address.
- Adjust the memory and CPU limits for the containers based on your systemâ€™s resources.
- Build the Docker image by running the following command: `docker build -t observability_image PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_DOCKERFILE`
- Deploy and start the monitoring system environment by running: `docker-compose up`


# Usage:
 
To use monitoring in your calculations on MEE or some other Slurm environment you have to add to your liquid.sh file these script lines:

```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanoScience/observability/main/monitoring.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SanoScience/observability/main/monitoring-env.yml
source monitoring.sh
CASE_NUMBER=`param_or_empty {{ case_number }}`; PIPELINE_IDENTIFIER=`param_or_empty {{ pipeline_identifier }}`; PIPELINE_NAME=`param_or_empty {{ pipeline_name }}`; STEP_NAME=`param_or_empty {{ step_name }}`

setup_conda monitoring-env.yml
install_packages`
run_monitoring "--custom-labels case_number:$CASE_NUMBER pipeline_identifier:$PIPELINE_IDENTIFIER pipeline_name:$PIPELINE_NAME step_name:$STEP_NAME" &
```

There can be multiple name of labels (ex: label1) and for every label one value (ex: value1)

# Telemetry data visualisation:

The four services are responsible for data visualization, each serving a distinct purpose and providing different insights into the monitored resource utilization.
