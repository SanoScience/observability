#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# JupyterHub(Application) configuration
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## An Application for starting a Multi-User Jupyter Notebook server.

## Maximum number of concurrent servers that can be active at a time.
#  
#  Setting this can limit the total resources your users can consume.
#  
#  An active server is any server that's not fully stopped. It is considered
#  active from the time it has been requested until the time that it has
#  completely stopped.
#  
#  If this many user servers are active, users will not be able to launch new
#  servers until a server is shutdown. Spawn requests will be rejected with a 429
#  error asking them to try again.
#  
#  If set to 0, no limit is enforced.
#  Default: 0
# c.JupyterHub.active_server_limit = 0

## Duration (in seconds) to determine the number of active users.
#  Default: 1800
# c.JupyterHub.active_user_window = 1800

## Resolution (in seconds) for updating activity
#  
#  If activity is registered that is less than activity_resolution seconds more
#  recent than the current value, the new value will be ignored.
#  
#  This avoids too many writes to the Hub database.
#  Default: 30
# c.JupyterHub.activity_resolution = 30

## DEPRECATED since version 2.0.0.
#  
#          The default admin role has full permissions, use custom RBAC scopes instead to
#          create restricted administrator roles.
#          https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/index.html
#  Default: False
# c.JupyterHub.admin_access = False

## DEPRECATED since version 0.7.2, use Authenticator.admin_users instead.
#  Default: set()
# c.JupyterHub.admin_users = set()

## Allow named single-user servers per user
#  Default: False
# c.JupyterHub.allow_named_servers = False

## Answer yes to any questions (e.g. confirm overwrite)
#  Default: False
# c.JupyterHub.answer_yes = False

## The default amount of records returned by a paginated endpoint
#  Default: 50
# c.JupyterHub.api_page_default_limit = 50

## The maximum amount of records that can be returned at once
#  Default: 200
# c.JupyterHub.api_page_max_limit = 200

## PENDING DEPRECATION: consider using services
#  
#          Dict of token:username to be loaded into the database.
#  
#          Allows ahead-of-time generation of API tokens for use by externally managed services,
#          which authenticate as JupyterHub users.
#  
#          Consider using services for general services that talk to the
#  JupyterHub API.
#  Default: {}
# c.JupyterHub.api_tokens = {}

## Authentication for prometheus metrics
#  Default: True
# c.JupyterHub.authenticate_prometheus = True

## Class for authenticating users.
#  
#          This should be a subclass of :class:`jupyterhub.auth.Authenticator`
#  
#          with an :meth:`authenticate` method that:
#  
#          - is a coroutine (asyncio or tornado)
#          - returns username on success, None on failure
#          - takes two arguments: (handler, data),
#            where `handler` is the calling web.RequestHandler,
#            and `data` is the POST form data from the login page.
#  
#          .. versionchanged:: 1.0
#              authenticators may be registered via entry points,
#              e.g. `c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'pam'`
#  
#  Currently installed: 
#    - default: jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator
#    - dummy: jupyterhub.auth.DummyAuthenticator
#    - null: jupyterhub.auth.NullAuthenticator
#    - pam: jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator
#  Default: 'jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator'
# c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = 'jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator'

## The base URL of the entire application.
#  
#          Add this to the beginning of all JupyterHub URLs.
#          Use base_url to run JupyterHub within an existing website.
#  
#          .. deprecated: 0.9
#              Use JupyterHub.bind_url
#  Default: '/'
# c.JupyterHub.base_url = '/'

## The public facing URL of the whole JupyterHub application.
#  
#          This is the address on which the proxy will bind.
#          Sets protocol, ip, base_url
#  Default: 'http://:8000'
# c.JupyterHub.bind_url = 'http://:8000'

## Whether to shutdown the proxy when the Hub shuts down.
#  
#          Disable if you want to be able to teardown the Hub while leaving the
#  proxy running.
#  
#          Only valid if the proxy was starting by the Hub process.
#  
#          If both this and cleanup_servers are False, sending SIGINT to the Hub will
#          only shutdown the Hub, leaving everything else running.
#  
#          The Hub should be able to resume from database state.
#  Default: True
# c.JupyterHub.cleanup_proxy = True

## Whether to shutdown single-user servers when the Hub shuts down.
#  
#          Disable if you want to be able to teardown the Hub while leaving the
#  single-user servers running.
#  
#          If both this and cleanup_proxy are False, sending SIGINT to the Hub will
#          only shutdown the Hub, leaving everything else running.
#  
#          The Hub should be able to resume from database state.
#  Default: True
# c.JupyterHub.cleanup_servers = True

## Maximum number of concurrent users that can be spawning at a time.
#  
#  Spawning lots of servers at the same time can cause performance problems for
#  the Hub or the underlying spawning system. Set this limit to prevent bursts of
#  logins from attempting to spawn too many servers at the same time.
#  
#  This does not limit the number of total running servers. See
#  active_server_limit for that.
#  
#  If more than this many users attempt to spawn at a time, their requests will
#  be rejected with a 429 error asking them to try again. Users will have to wait
#  for some of the spawning services to finish starting before they can start
#  their own.
#  
#  If set to 0, no limit is enforced.
#  Default: 100
# c.JupyterHub.concurrent_spawn_limit = 100

## The config file to load
#  Default: 'jupyterhub_config.py'
# c.JupyterHub.config_file = 'jupyterhub_config.py'

## DEPRECATED: does nothing
#  Default: False
# c.JupyterHub.confirm_no_ssl = False

## Enable `__Host-` prefix on authentication cookies.
#  
#          The `__Host-` prefix on JupyterHub cookies provides further
